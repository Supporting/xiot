Prerequisites
=============
	X3DLoader requires XercesC XML parser and zlib compression library to
	build.
	
	XercesC
	=======
	The Apache XML parser library is contained in the contrib directory for
	win32 and win64 build with VC9. On Linux system, XercecC can easily be 
	obtained using the package system, i.e. via:
	
	sudo apt-get install libxerces27 libxerces27-dev
	
	If not, consult the following URI to get binaries or the source for 
	XercesC:
	http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/
	
	The library has been tested with Xerces versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.0.
	
	zlib
	====
	The zlib compression library is packaged with many systems. Static builds
	for win32/64 build with VC are contained in the contrib directory. On Linux 
	systems, zlib can easily be obtained using the package system, i.e. via:
	
	sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev
	
	If not, consult the following URI to get binaries or the source for 
	zlib:
	http://www.zlib.net/
	
	The library has been tested with zlib version 1.2.3.
	
	For additional prerequisites for the example viewer and for the ParaView
	plugin please refer to the README files in subdirectories example and 
	plugins.
